# Ollis Pen Randomization

**Ollis Pen Randomization** is a Python-based application designed for randomizing agricultural research pens. It simplifies the process of assigning treatments to research pens in a randomized manner, ensuring unbiased and scientifically valid results. The application is standalone and can be run automatically without any additional configuration or external dependencies.

## Features
- Automatically randomizes pens in poultry research.
- Allows for easy configuration and execution.
- Simple, user-friendly design for researchers and poultry scientists.
- No external dependencies required for basic functionality.

## Installation
## Download the ZIP File
You can download the app's source code as a ZIP file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzfGj2g4D5uLPal0uPPPM7ZaqKDq_QY1/view?usp=sharing).

 **Run the application**:
Open and run, no installation needed.

NOTE: this contains no malware, however it was done without any digital programmer stamp on it (making the computer think its malicious), so you will have to go to security and settings to tell your computer to open app anyway. Also this is a Mac Only program.

## Usage

Upon running the script, the program will automatically execute and generate a randomized assignment for your poultry pens. The results will be displayed in the console.

- **Input**: The program may ask for certain inputs such as the number of pens, treatments, or any specific parameters relevant to your study.
- **Output**: The randomized pen assignments will be displayed, ready for use in your research study.
